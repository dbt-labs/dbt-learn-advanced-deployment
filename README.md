### Introduction to Advanced Deployment Course
This course is designed to help dbt users expand their knowledge on deploying their dbt project. Since the course focuses primarily on deployment configurations, the repository for this course is relatively unimportant. However, the creators of this course did want to include at least one incremental model so that certain jobs that require awareness of incremental models could be exmplified.
